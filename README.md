# Setup Requirements
- [x] WordPress Instance - you can learn more <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/">here</a>
- [x] Composer - you can learn more <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md">here</a>
# Installation
1. Clone the plugin directory into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/claudionhangapc/afa-submission-manager.git && cd afa-submission-manager
```
2. Install project dependencies using `composer install`
3. Activate the `WP All Forms API` plugin through the WordPress plugin administration page.
4. After activating the plugin on your machine, the access route will be formed by the site's base, `https://mysite.com`, for the API base `/wp-json/afa-submission-manager/v1`, and the endpoint, e.g.: `/ping`. Therefore, the route `https://mysite.com/wp-json/afa-submission-manager/v1/ping` allows you to check if the API is functioning correctly, returning a `{"ping": "pong"}` response.

# Plugins

The idea is to implement endpoints for various plugins, each with at least 50,000 active installations. Those marked with `ok` have already been implemented.
